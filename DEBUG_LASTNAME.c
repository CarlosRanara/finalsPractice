/* 
    CAN YOU FIX THIS BUGGY PROGRAM? 

   This program SHOULD:
   1.  input an integer value n inside main(), 
   2.  generate and prints a list of 1st n prime number (one integer per line of output),
   3.  and finally, it prints the sum of the 1st n prime numbers.
     
   BUT this source code contains multiple syntax and logical errors!  
   Can you FIND and and FIX all of them? 

   HINTS:  
   * All the comments are correct.  Read the comments to guide you in the debugging task.
   * A common error by beginning programmers is forgetting to initialize 
     counter and accumulator variables.
   
   RESTRICTIONS:
   * You are NOT allowed to delete any line of code.   
   * You may need to add a line of code but only in existing blank or empty lines, for example
     line numbers 40 to 43.
