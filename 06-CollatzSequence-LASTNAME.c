*  Implement the function CollatzSequence(n).
*
*  CollatzSequence(n) generates/prints a sequence of integers starting from n.
*  The next term in the sequence is computed as follows:
*    a.  if n is even, then the next number is n/2 
*    b.  otherwise (i.e., if n is odd), then the next number is 3 * n + 1
*
*  Although it has not been proven yet, it is thought that the sequence
*  will eventually end in a value of 1.
*
*  Reference: http://planetmath.org/collatzsequence
*
*  EXAMPLES:
*
*  Example #1: If n is 8, COllatzSequence(8) generates/output the following:
*             
*              8 4 2 1 
*
*  Example #2: If n is 5, CollatzSequence(5) generates/output the following:
*
*              5 16 8 4 2 1
*    
*  Example #3: If n is 13, CollatzSequence(13) generates/output the following:
*
*              13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
